# Pseudostates {#pseudostate}

A pseudostate is a predefined state-like entity that can be the source or the target of a transition. We call them <i>pseudo</i>states (and not simply states) because, unlike states, they cannot be active; they generally serve as transitions.

Maki currently supports this pseudostate:

* @subpage initial.

> [!note]
> The final state is **not** a pseudostate, because it can be active.
