# Concepts {#concepts}

This part of the documentation presents the concepts from the state machine theory that Maki implements.

For each concept is given:
* (what?) a general definition;
* (why/when?) the reasons why you might want to use it and when to use it;
* (how?) the interface that Maki offers to use it.

The concepts are the following:
* @subpage state-machine
* @subpage event
* @subpage state
* @subpage action
* @subpage guard
* @subpage run-to-completion
* @subpage orthogonal-region
* @subpage composite-state
