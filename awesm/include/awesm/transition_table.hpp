/**
@defgroup TransitionTable Transition Table
@brief These are the types and functions that must be used to define transition tables.

A transition table lists all the possible transitions from a state (the source
state) to another (the target state) in a region of a state machine.

You can define a transition table by using this class template directly:
```cpp
using transition_table_t = awesm::transition_table_tpl
<
    awesm::transition<off, button_press, on,  turn_light_on, has_enough_power>,
    awesm::transition<on,  button_press, off, turn_light_off>
>;
```

â€¦ but using the @ref transition_table alias and the
@ref transition_table_tpl::add member type template is usually the preferred,
more concise way to do so:
```cpp
using transition_table_t = awesm::transition_table
    ::add<off, button_press, on,  turn_light_on, has_enough_power>
    ::add<on,  button_press, off, turn_light_off>
;
```

Note that the first usage may be more appropriate in the context of a template
in order to avoid awkward `typename`s and `template`s.
